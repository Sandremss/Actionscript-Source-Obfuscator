How to run the .jar file
------------------------


Double click (if you have Java 6 runtime installed)


Run from Terminal:

GUI Mode:

	$ java -jar Obfuscator.jar 

Terminal Mode:

	$ java -cp Obfuscator.jar main.Obfuscate <args>

Arguments:

-nolocal | don't obfuscate local variables
-nopackages | don't obfuscate packages
-noclasses | don't obfuscate class names
-uniquenames | give every field an unique name
-namelength <length> | the length of each unique name, you need to also use -uniquenames
-help | display available commands



Tips:

-When using unique names you don't need a large number for the name length, a length of 4 already gives 13 million possibilities.

-If you want individual classes, packages, or variables not obfuscated you have to use the GUI mode and deselect them.

-The more .AS files it has the more it can obfuscate, as it works with references. If you make use of a library and have the source code of it, you should include those .as files to get better obfuscation.

-The obfuscation will break on dynamically typed fields, always type those things or exclude them from the renaming process.
**!!!NOTE!!!** THIS WILL GENERATE RUNTIME ERRORS OTHERWISE!

-If you receive an error try running the program with the command line in order to see debug traces and get an error report.


Unsupported:

1.	Anonymous Functions, will terminate the program
		They're slower and have no architectual use, if you want to manually obfuscate your program: by all means, you won't need this obfuscator =).
2.	Namespaces, will generate errors
		They're not too usefull.
3.	The 'with' statement, will generate errors
		Its slow and unhandy to read because of the extra { it creates
4.	mxml, will not get parsed; only .as files
		This is an actionscript obfuscator, not a UI obfuscator.
5.	Local functions, may generate errors
		there is a chance where there can be collisions with names.
6.	Dynamically typed members, may generate errors
		Without a type the variable or function cannot be referenced correctly, look out for warnings when you compile your original code for this.
7.	Vector object; does not have type safety, may generate errors
		It would be too tedious to create this just for Vector, Vector is only faster than Array with primitive values mostly and they should not be a problem.
8.	Global function or field in .as file
9.	Possibly more, things I haven't heard of
